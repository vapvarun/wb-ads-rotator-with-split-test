## Break-Even Calculations

### Classifieds Break-Even

Pro Annual Cost: $[XX]
Featured Listing Price: $20
Break-even: $[XX] ÷ $20 = [X] featured listings/year

**That's [X] featured listings per month to break even.**
Everything after that is profit.

### Advertiser Portal Break-Even

Pro Annual Cost: $[XX]
Your hourly rate: $50
Time saved per advertiser: 2 hours = $100 value
Break-even: $[XX] ÷ $100 = [X] advertisers/year

**That's [X] advertisers per year to break even on time alone.**
Revenue increase is bonus.

### A/B Testing Break-Even

Pro Annual Cost: $[XX]
Current monthly revenue: $500
Needed improvement: $[XX] ÷ 12 = $[X]/month
Percentage improvement needed: $[X] ÷ $500 = [X]%

**A [X]% improvement in ad revenue pays for Pro.**
Most users see 20-50% improvement from testing.

## Objection: "The Free Version Seems Complete"

**Response:**
You're right - the free version handles most use cases. Consider Pro if:

1. You want passive income from classifieds
2. You sell ad space directly to businesses
3. You need data-driven optimization (A/B testing)
4. You want detailed revenue analytics

If none of those apply, stick with free. We don't push upgrades you don't need.
