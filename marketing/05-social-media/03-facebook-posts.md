## Post 1: Introduction Post

**Image suggestion:** Plugin dashboard screenshot or logo

**Text:**

Hey WordPress community! 👋

Just wanted to share a tool we've been working on: WB Ad Manager.

It's a free plugin that handles:
✅ Display ads (image, HTML, AdSense)
✅ Affiliate link cloaking & tracking
✅ Popups and sticky bars
✅ BuddyPress & bbPress integration
✅ Scheduling and targeting

We built it because managing ads with multiple plugins was getting ridiculous. Now everything's in one place.

Free version has no limits. Pro adds classifieds and advertiser portals for those who need them.

Would love feedback from anyone who tries it!

## Post 3: Tip Post

**Image suggestion:** Simple graphic with the tip

**Text:**

Quick WordPress tip for you:

Sidebar ads get less than 0.5% click-through rate. Banner blindness is real.

Want better results? Try placing an ad AFTER paragraph 3 in your posts.

That's where readers are most engaged. In-content ads typically get 3-5x more clicks.

WB Ad Manager makes this easy:
1. Create ad
2. Choose "After Paragraph" placement
3. Enter "3"
4. Done!

Free plugin. Takes 2 minutes.

Try it this week and see if your CTR improves!

**Text:**

Affiliate marketers - this one's for you!

You know what I hate about affiliate links?

1. They're ugly
2. They make readers suspicious
3. You can't track them
4. They break and you don't know

WB Ad Manager fixes all of this (for free):

✨ Clean URLs: yoursite.com/go/product-name
📊 Click tracking on every link
🔔 Broken link alerts
📦 Bulk import your existing links

Stop managing links in spreadsheets. Get them organized.

## Post 6: Feature Highlight - BuddyPress

Running a BuddyPress community?

Here's how to monetize WITHOUT ruining the member experience:

WB Ad Manager places ads INSIDE the activity feed - between posts, just like sponsored content on any social platform.

You can also:
👥 Show ads to free members only
💎 Hide ads for premium members
📱 Optimize for mobile

It integrates automatically - if BuddyPress is active, the placements appear.

Same works for bbPress forums too!

## Post 11: Case Study/Story

**Image suggestion:** Before/after results or success graphic

**Text:**

Quick story from one of our users:

Sarah runs a food blog. She was using:
- AdSense plugin for ads
- Separate plugin for affiliate links
- Another for popups

Three dashboards. Three sets of settings. No unified tracking.

After switching to WB Ad Manager:
- One dashboard for everything
- Moved ads from sidebar to after paragraph 4
- CTR improved 280%
- Site loads noticeably faster

Sometimes the simplest change makes the biggest difference.

If you're managing multiple monetization plugins, consider consolidating.
