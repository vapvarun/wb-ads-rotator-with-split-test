## FAQ Section

### How does annual pricing work?
Pro licenses are billed annually. Your license includes one year of updates and support. After the first year, renew at a discounted rate to continue receiving updates. Your plugin will continue working even if you don't renew - you just won't get new updates.

### Can I upgrade from Single to Unlimited later?
Yes. Contact support and we'll apply your Single Site payment as a credit toward Unlimited.

### Can I use the free version on client sites?
Yes. The free version is GPL licensed and can be used on any site, including client sites.

### What happens when my Pro license expires?
The plugin continues working with all features intact. You simply stop receiving updates and priority support. You can renew anytime to resume updates.

### Do you offer refunds?
Yes. We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee on all Pro purchases. If you're not satisfied, contact support within 14 days of purchase for a full refund.

### Is there a lifetime license option?
Contact us for lifetime license pricing and availability.
