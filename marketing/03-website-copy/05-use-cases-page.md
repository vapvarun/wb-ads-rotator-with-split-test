## Use Case 1: The Blogger

### Headline
"Monetize Your Blog Without Ruining the Reader Experience"

### The Challenge
You've built an audience and you want to earn from your content. But you don't want your site to look like a NASCAR vehicle covered in banners. You need ads that convert without annoying readers.

### How WB Ad Manager Helps

**Strategic Placements**
Instead of cramming sidebar banners, place one well-designed ad after paragraph 3 - right where engagement peaks. Or use a non-intrusive sticky footer bar. One good placement beats ten bad ones.

**AdSense Made Easy**
Connect your AdSense account once. Create ad units with full control over placement, targeting, and scheduling. No more copying code into widgets.

**Clean Affiliate Links**
Turn ugly Amazon links into clean URLs like `yoursite.com/go/best-camera`. Track clicks to see which product recommendations actually get clicked.

### What You'll Use
- Image ads and AdSense integration
- After-paragraph placement
- Sticky footer bar
- Affiliate link cloaking
- Basic analytics

### The Result
A professional-looking blog that earns revenue without compromising the reading experience. You know exactly which content drives clicks.

## Use Case 2: The Affiliate Marketer

### Headline
"Manage Hundreds of Affiliate Links Without Losing Your Mind"

### The Challenge
You've got affiliate links scattered across hundreds of posts. Different networks, different products, no central tracking. When Amazon changes a link structure, you spend hours hunting down broken URLs.

### How WB Ad Manager Helps

**Central Link Management**
All your affiliate links in one dashboard. Create once, use anywhere. When a link changes, update it in one place.

**Professional Cloaking**
No more ugly links with tracking parameters. Every link becomes `yoursite.com/go/product-name`. Looks better, converts better.

**Click Tracking**
See exactly which links get clicked, which pages drive traffic, and which products generate interest. Focus your content on what works.

**Broken Link Detection**
WB Ad Manager monitors your destination URLs. When a product is discontinued or a link structure changes, you get an alert - before visitors hit 404 errors.

**Bulk Import**
Already have a spreadsheet of affiliate links? Import them all at once. Instant cloaking and tracking.

### What You'll Use
- Link cloaking (all links)
- Click tracking
- Broken link monitoring
- Bulk import
- Link analytics dashboard

### The Result
Complete control over your affiliate links. You know what's working, catch problems early, and spend time creating content instead of managing URLs.

## Use Case 3: The BuddyPress Community Owner

### Headline
"Turn Your Engaged Community Into Revenue"

### The Challenge
You've built a thriving BuddyPress community. Members post daily, groups are active, engagement is high. But monetizing feels awkward - you don't want to disrupt the community experience with intrusive ads.

### How WB Ad Manager Helps

**Native Activity Stream Ads**
Insert ads directly into the activity feed - the most-viewed part of any BuddyPress site. Ads look like natural content, not interruptions.

**Profile Page Ads**
Monetize member profile views with relevant ads. Target based on user roles or membership levels.

**Selective Targeting**
Show ads to logged-out visitors and free members. Hide them from premium members as a perk. Or show different ads to different membership tiers.

**BuddyBoss Compatibility**
Using BuddyBoss? WB Ad Manager works seamlessly with the BuddyBoss theme and plugin suite.

### What You'll Use
- BuddyPress activity placement
- BuddyPress profile placement
- User role targeting

## Use Case 4: The Forum Owner

### Headline
"Monetize Forum Traffic the Smart Way"

### The Challenge
Your bbPress forum has thousands of topics and active discussions. That's a lot of page views going unmonetized. But forum users are sensitive - they'll complain loudly about intrusive ads.

### How WB Ad Manager Helps

**Topic-Based Placement**
Insert ads within forum topics - after the original post, between replies, or at the end. You control the frequency.

**High-Traffic Optimization**
Forums generate massive page views but often have low ad engagement. Strategic placement increases visibility without disruption.

**Device-Aware Ads**
Forum users often browse on mobile. Target mobile-optimized ads to mobile users, desktop banners to desktop users.

**Schedule Around Activity**
If your forum is most active on weekends, schedule your best ads for Saturday and Sunday.

### What You'll Use
- bbPress topic placement
- bbPress reply placement
- Device targeting
- Day/time scheduling
- Frequency controls

### The Result
Forum monetization that works with your community, not against it. Revenue grows while complaints stay low.

## Use Case 5: The Local Directory (PRO)

### Headline
"Build a Classified Listings Business in Your Niche"

### The Challenge

### How WB Ad Manager Helps

**Complete Classified System**
Frontend submission forms, categories, locations, images, contact forms - everything you need out of the box.

**Revenue from Day One**
Charge for featured listings, highlighted placements, and urgency badges. Users pay from their wallet balance (Stripe, PayPal, or WooCommerce).

**Automatic Management**
Listings expire automatically. Renewal reminders go out via email. You focus on marketing while the system runs itself.

**Moderate Submissions**
Review listings before they go live. Approve quality posts, reject spam. Maintain directory quality with minimal effort.

### What You'll Use
- Classified marketplace module
- Category and location taxonomies
- Frontend submission forms
- Paid upgrades (featured, highlighted, urgent)

## Use Case 6: The Publisher (PRO)

### Headline
"Let Advertisers Manage Themselves"

### The Challenge
You sell ad space directly to businesses. But the manual process is killing you - emails, negotiations, invoices, setup, reporting. Every sale takes hours of work.

### How WB Ad Manager Helps

**Self-Service Advertiser Portal**
Advertisers create their own accounts, design their own ads, and submit for your approval. No back-and-forth emails.

**Automated Payments**
Advertisers add funds to their wallet. When ads run, credits are deducted automatically. No invoicing, no payment chasing.

**Package-Based Pricing**
Create ad packages at different price points. Basic, Premium, Featured - each with different placements and pricing models (CPM, CPC, or flat rate).

**One-Click Approval**
Review submissions in your queue. Approve with one click. Reject with feedback if needed. Everything else is automatic.

**Advertiser Analytics**
Advertisers see their own performance data - impressions, clicks, CTR. They can optimize their campaigns without asking you for reports.

### What You'll Use
- Advertiser portal
- Wallet system
- Package management
- Approval workflow
- Advertiser analytics
- Revenue dashboard

### The Result
A scalable advertising business. Advertisers serve themselves. You approve quality ads and watch revenue grow without the manual overhead.
