Every day, visitors come to your site and leave. Some click ads. Some don't. Most site owners have no idea which content makes money and which doesn't.

**Sound familiar?**
- Scattered ads with no strategy
- Ugly affiliate links that visitors don't trust
- No clue which placements actually convert
- Paying for premium ad plugins that do half the job

**There's a better way.**
