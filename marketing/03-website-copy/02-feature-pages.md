### The Placement Problem

Most WordPress sites stick ads in sidebars and call it a day. But sidebar ads have the lowest click-through rates of any placement. The real money is in:

- Content placements (before, after, between paragraphs)
- Strategic popups (exit intent, scroll depth)
- Sticky elements (footer bars, corner ads)
- Community integrations (activity feeds, forums)

**WB Ad Manager gives you all of these** - configured in minutes, no developer needed.

### Hero Section

**Headline:** "Professional Affiliate Links in Seconds"

**Subheadline:** "Cloak ugly affiliate URLs, track every click, and never lose a commission to broken links."

**CTA:** "Download Free Plugin"

---

### The Affiliate Link Problem

Raw affiliate links are:
- **Ugly** - Long strings of tracking codes that look spammy
- **Untrustworthy** - Visitors see the affiliate tag and hesitate
- **Impossible to track** - No idea which links generate revenue
- **Fragile** - One changed URL breaks links across your entire site

**WB Ad Manager solves all of these problems.**

---

### Feature: Link Cloaking

Turn this:
```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW?tag=yoursite-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1
```

Into this:
```
yoursite.com/go/best-headphones
```

---

# Page 3: BuddyPress & bbPress Integration

## URL: /features/buddypress-bbpress-ads/

### Hero Section

**Headline:** "Monetize Your WordPress Community"

**Subheadline:** "Native ad placements for BuddyPress social networks and bbPress forums - no code required."

**CTA:** "Download Free Plugin"

---

### The Community Monetization Challenge

You've built a thriving community. Members are active, discussions are flowing, engagement is high. But how do you monetize without:

- Disrupting the user experience
- Installing multiple plugins that conflict
- Spending hours on custom development

**WB Ad Manager integrates directly with BuddyPress and bbPress** to give you native ad placements that feel like part of the platform.

---

### BuddyPress Placements

**Activity Stream Ads**
Insert ads directly into the activity feed - the most-viewed area of any BuddyPress site. Choose how often ads appear (every 5 activities, every 10, etc.).

**Profile Ads**
Display ads on member profile pages. Target based on profile fields, membership level, or user role.

**Group Ads**
Show relevant ads within group pages. Perfect for sponsored content that matches group topics.

---

### bbPress Placements

**Topic Ads**
Display ads within forum topics - after the first reply, between replies, or at the end.

**Reply Ads**
Insert ads between forum replies at intervals you control.

**Forum Ads**
Show ads on forum archive pages, between topic listings.

---

### Why Native Integration Matters

**Generic ad plugins** force you to inject ads via shortcodes or PHP code - creating maintenance headaches and breaking with theme updates.

**WB Ad Manager** uses BuddyPress and bbPress hooks directly. When those plugins are active, the placements appear automatically. When they're not, the placements hide gracefully.

No conflicts. No broken layouts. No extra configuration.

**CTA:** "Download Free Plugin"

---

### The AdSense Setup Problem

Google AdSense is one of the easiest ways to monetize a website, but managing it can be frustrating:

- Copying ad codes into widgets repeatedly
- No control over which pages show ads
- Can't target by device or user type
- Auto Ads placing ads in awkward spots

**WB Ad Manager gives you complete control over your AdSense ads** while keeping the simplicity you love.

---

### Feature: Publisher ID Configuration

Enter your AdSense Publisher ID once in settings. All your ad units automatically connect.

---

### Feature: Multiple Ad Formats

Create AdSense ads in any format Google supports:

- Responsive (recommended)
- Fixed size
- In-feed
- In-article
- Matched content

Each ad type has the appropriate fields - no guessing about what to paste where.

---

### Feature: Same Powerful Targeting

Your AdSense ads get the same targeting options as all other ads:

- Schedule by date and time
- Target specific devices
- Show to specific user roles
- Display on specific post types
- Include/exclude by category

**Run AdSense on blog posts but not landing pages.** Show AdSense to logged-out users while logged-in members see custom content. The control is yours.

---

### Feature: Auto Ads Support

Prefer Google's automatic placement? Enable Auto Ads globally and let Google optimize. Or use manual placement for complete control. Mix both approaches as needed.

**With WB Ad Manager Pro, you can build the same thing on your WordPress site.**

---

### How It Works

Approved listings display on your browse page. Featured listings appear at the top. Visitors browse, filter, and contact sellers.

### The Manual Ad Sales Problem

When you sell advertising manually:

1. Advertiser emails you
2. You negotiate terms
3. You create the ad
4. You send an invoice
5. You wait for payment
6. You activate the ad
7. You send performance reports

**That's hours of work for every single sale.**

---

**They register for an account**
Either automatically on signup or by request

**They add funds to their wallet**
Stripe, PayPal, or WooCommerce integration

**They create their own ads**
Upload images, write copy, choose placements

**They submit for approval**
You review and approve/reject with one click

**Their wallet is charged automatically**
No invoicing, no chasing payments

**They track their own performance**
Impressions, clicks, CTR - all in their dashboard

---

### Your Admin Experience

**Submission Queue**
See all pending ads in one place. Click to review.

**One-Click Approval**
Ad meets guidelines? Approve it. Ad goes live, wallet is charged, advertiser is notified.

**Rejection with Feedback**
Something wrong? Reject with a note. Advertiser fixes and resubmits.
