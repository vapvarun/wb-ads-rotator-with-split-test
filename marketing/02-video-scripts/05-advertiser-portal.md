## Introduction
**[TIME: 0:00-0:25]**

**[NARRATOR]**
"Imagine if advertisers could create their own ads, pay from their wallet balance, and track their own performance - without you doing any of the work. With WB Ad Manager Pro's Advertiser Portal, that's exactly what happens."

**[ON SCREEN]**
- Title: "Self-Service Advertiser Portal"
- Subtitle: "Scale Your Ad Business"

## The Problem with Manual Ad Management
**[TIME: 0:25-0:50]**

**[NARRATOR]**
"When you sell ad space manually, here's what happens: An advertiser emails you. You go back and forth on details. You create the ad. You send an invoice. You wait for payment. You activate the ad. That's hours of work for one sale."

**[ON SCREEN]**
- Email chain visualization
- Time spent: 2+ hours per advertiser

"With the Advertiser Portal, that entire process is automated."
