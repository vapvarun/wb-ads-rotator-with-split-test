## Email 1: Gentle Reminder (Day 30 of inactivity)

**Subject:** Is WB Ad Manager still working for you?

**Preview text:** Quick check-in from the team

---

**Body:**

Hey,

I noticed your WB Ad Manager dashboard has been quiet for a few weeks. Just wanted to check in.

**Everything okay?**

If you hit a snag or got confused about something, I'm here to help. Reply to this email with any questions.

**If you're just busy:**

Totally get it. When you're ready to come back, here's what's waiting for you:

- Your ads are still set up (if you published any)
- Your link tracking data is preserved
- All your settings are intact

**If you're not using ads right now:**

That's fine too. WB Ad Manager will be here when you need it.

But if you're monetizing your site some other way - or thinking about it - I'd love to hear what you're doing. Helps us build a better product.

Just hit reply.

## Email 2: Feature Reminder (Day 40 of inactivity)

**Subject:** 3 things you might not have tried yet

**Preview text:** Hidden features in WB Ad Manager

---

**Body:**

Hey,

Still haven't seen you in WB Ad Manager. Before you forget about us entirely, here are 3 features that often get overlooked:

---

**1. Affiliate Link Cloaking (Free)**

If you have any affiliate links on your site, you can:
- Cloak them with clean URLs (yoursite.com/go/product)
- Track every click automatically
- Get alerts when links break

Go to: WB Ad Manager → Links → Add New

---

**2. After-Paragraph Ads (Free)**

Sidebar ads get ignored. In-content ads get clicked.

Place an ad after paragraph 3 of your posts:
- Create or edit any ad
- Placement → After Paragraph
- Enter "3"
- Save

That's where readers are most engaged.

---

**3. Exit Intent Popups (Free)**

Only show a popup when someone's about to leave:
- Create or edit an ad
- Placement → Popup → Exit Intent
- Save

Not intrusive. High visibility. Works on most content sites.

---

**Pick one and try it this week.**

If you need help, just reply.

## Email 3: Feedback Request (Day 50 of inactivity)

**Subject:** Quick question (1 minute)

**Preview text:** Your feedback helps us improve

---

**Body:**

Hey,

You installed WB Ad Manager a while back but haven't used it recently. I'm curious why.

**Can you hit reply and let me know which of these applies?**

1. I'm too busy to set up ads right now
2. The plugin was confusing or hard to use
3. I couldn't figure out how to do something specific
4. Ads aren't right for my site
5. I'm using a different solution
6. Other (please explain)

**Your feedback helps us improve.**

If it was something about the plugin, I want to know so we can fix it. If it's just timing, no worries at all.

Takes 30 seconds to reply. I read every response personally.

Thanks,
The WBcom Designs Team

## Email 4: Last Chance Value Prop (Day 60 of inactivity)

**Subject:** One more thing before we stop emailing

**Preview text:** A quick summary of what you're missing

---

**Body:**

Hey,

This will be my last email about WB Ad Manager (unless you come back).

Before I go, here's a quick summary of what's waiting for you:

---

**What WB Ad Manager does (free):**

✓ Display image, HTML, or AdSense ads anywhere
✓ Cloak and track affiliate links
✓ Target by device, user role, and schedule
✓ Place ads in BuddyPress and bbPress
✓ Use popups, sticky bars, and in-content placements
✓ Get basic click and impression analytics

---

**What Pro adds (if you ever need it):**

✓ Classified marketplace (users post & pay)
✓ Advertiser portal (self-service ads)
✓ A/B testing
✓ Advanced analytics with charts and exports
✓ Geographic targeting

---

**If you're not using the plugin:**

You can deactivate or delete it anytime. No hard feelings.

But if there's a chance you'll want to monetize your site in the future, it might be worth keeping installed. Takes up minimal resources when inactive.

**If you have questions:**

Reply anytime. I'm here even if you're not actively using the plugin.

Thanks for trying WB Ad Manager. Maybe we'll see you again.

P.S. If you ever do come back, the latest version has [RECENT NOTABLE FEATURE]. Worth checking out.
