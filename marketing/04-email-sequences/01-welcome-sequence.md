## Email 2: Feature Discovery (Day 2)

**Subject:** 5 things you can do with WB Ad Manager (that you might have missed)

**Preview text:** Most users don't discover these until week 2

---

**Body:**

Hey,

Now that you've had a day with WB Ad Manager, here are some features that often get overlooked:

**1. Affiliate Link Cloaking**
Turn ugly affiliate URLs into clean links like yoursite.com/go/product-name. Every click is tracked automatically.

**2. Popup Ads (That Don't Annoy)**
Exit intent popups only trigger when someone's about to leave. Timed popups wait until readers are engaged. Set up at WB Ad Manager → Add New → Placement: Popup.

**3. Device Targeting**
Show different ads on mobile vs desktop. Perfect for optimizing click-through rates on different screen sizes.

**4. After Paragraph Placement**
Instead of sidebar banners, place an ad after paragraph 3 of your posts - right where engagement peaks. Studies show in-content ads get 3x more clicks than sidebars.

**5. AdSense Without Code Copying**
Enter your Publisher ID once. Create AdSense ads with the same targeting and placement options as custom ads. No more pasting ad codes into widgets.

**This week's challenge:** Try placing one ad after paragraph 3 on your posts. See if your click-through rate improves.

Go to any ad → Placement → After Paragraph → Enter "3" → Save.

## Email 4: Analytics & Optimization (Day 8)

**Subject:** Your ads are tracking - here's what to look for

**Preview text:** Turn impressions and clicks into insights

---

**Body:**

Hey,

If you've been running ads for the past week, you should have some data by now. Here's how to use it:

**Find Your Dashboard**
Go to WB Ad Manager → [Any Ad] → View Stats

You'll see:
- **Impressions** - How many times the ad was displayed
- **Clicks** - How many times it was clicked
- **CTR** - Click-through rate (clicks ÷ impressions)

**What the numbers mean:**

| CTR | Interpretation |
|-----|----------------|
| <0.5% | Poor - try new creative or placement |
| 0.5-1% | Average - room for improvement |
| 1-2% | Good - solid performance |
| >2% | Excellent - find more placements like this |

**Quick wins to improve CTR:**

1. **Change placement** - Move from sidebar to after paragraph 3
2. **Update creative** - Test a different image or headline
3. **Tighten targeting** - Show only on relevant content categories
4. **Try different sizes** - Sometimes smaller or larger converts better

**For affiliate links:**
Check Links → [Your Link] to see click counts. Your top-clicked links reveal what your audience cares about. Create more content around those topics.
