## Email 1: Feature Limit Trigger

**Trigger:** User tries to access Pro-only feature (classifieds, A/B testing, etc.)
**Subject:** Unlock the feature you just tried to use

**Preview text:** You found something good

---

**Body:**

Hey,

I noticed you just tried to access [FEATURE NAME] in WB Ad Manager. That's a Pro feature - you've got good instincts.

**Here's what [FEATURE NAME] can do for you:**

[DYNAMIC CONTENT BASED ON FEATURE]

**If feature = Classifieds:**
Turn your site into a classified marketplace. Users post listings, pay for featured placements, and you collect passive revenue. Perfect for local directories, job boards, or buy/sell communities.

**If feature = A/B Testing:**
Stop guessing which ad creative works. Run scientific tests, get statistical confidence, and automatically promote winners. The difference between 1% and 2% CTR doubles your revenue.

**If feature = Advertiser Portal:**
Let businesses manage their own ads. They sign up, add funds, create campaigns, and track their own stats. You just approve and collect.

**If feature = Advanced Analytics:**
Charts, revenue tracking, device breakdown, geographic data. Make data-driven decisions about your monetization strategy.

---

**What Pro costs:**

Single Site: $[XX]/year
Unlimited Sites: $[XX]/year

Both include one year of updates and priority support.

## Email 2: Usage Milestone

**Trigger:** User creates 10+ ads OR tracks 50+ link clicks
**Subject:** You're doing great - here's how to do better

**Preview text:** Data from your first [X] ads shows potential

---

**Body:**

Hey,

Nice work! You've created [X] ads in WB Ad Manager. Your site is on its way to real monetization.

**But here's something to think about:**

Right now, you can see impressions and clicks. But you can't see:

- Which ads generate actual revenue
- Which placements outperform others over time
- Whether desktop or mobile converts better
- Geographic patterns in your audience
- Statistical confidence in your ad choices

**That's guesswork. And guesswork costs money.**

WB Ad Manager Pro gives you the data to make smart decisions:

📊 **Time-series charts** - See trends, not just totals
💰 **Revenue tracking** - Connect ads to actual money
📱 **Device breakdown** - Optimize for each screen size
🌍 **Geographic data** - Know where your audience lives
🧪 **A/B testing** - Prove which ads work, scientifically

**Here's what I'd do if I were you:**

1. Look at your top 3 ads by clicks
2. Imagine having charts showing their performance over the last 30 days
3. Think about what you'd change if you knew which devices they performed best on

That's what Pro gives you.

## Email 3: Revenue Angle

**Trigger:** User has ads running for 30+ days
**Subject:** A question about your ad revenue

**Preview text:** Quick math on what you might be missing

---

**Body:**

Hey,

You've had ads running for over a month now. I have a question:

**Do you know how much you're actually earning?**

If you're running AdSense or affiliate links, you probably check those dashboards separately. But do you know:

- Which specific ads drive the most revenue?
- Which placements convert best on your site?
- Which content types earn the most per visitor?

Without this data, you're optimizing in the dark.

**Quick math:**

Let's say you're earning $500/month from ads.

If Pro's analytics helped you improve performance by just 20%, that's an extra $100/month - $1,200/year.

Pro costs [$XX]/year.

That's a [X]x return on investment.

And that's conservative. Some users see 50%+ improvements once they have real data to work with.

**What Pro's analytics show you:**

- Revenue by ad, placement, and time period
- Charts that reveal trends and patterns
- Device and geographic breakdowns
- Exportable data for deeper analysis

Stop guessing. Start knowing.

**"Finally, real data"**

"I was running ads for a year with no idea what was working. Pro's analytics showed me that my sidebar ads had 0.3% CTR while after-paragraph ads hit 2.1%. I moved everything to content placement and tripled my revenue."
— [Name], Blogger

---

**"Advertisers love the portal"**

"I used to spend hours creating ads for local businesses. Now they sign up, add funds, and submit their own campaigns. I approve in 30 seconds. My workload dropped by 90%."
— [Name], Local News Publisher

---

**"A/B testing pays for itself"**

"I tested two versions of my main banner. The winner had 47% higher CTR. That single test more than paid for my Pro license."
— [Name], Affiliate Marketer
